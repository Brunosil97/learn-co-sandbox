#Effective programmers take the time to really understand the problem they're trying to solve. Once they understanf it, they're more focused, decided steps with mindfulness to implement the solution. LEARNING TO PROGRAM IS THE ART OF SOLVING PROBLEMS. Its the main muscle that you are constantly developing. 

#Problem solving in the abstract:
#What you're doing is following a process that will solve the original problem. But how do we develop that process? 
#Good programmers do this every time they start on a new bit of work, from adding a little updated feature to creating a brand new project from scratch. They use a problem solving process to create code that solves the problem at hand. For example they ask questions: 

#What is the problem I'm trying to solve?
#What does the output look like? what is the end result im trying to build?
#What inputs do i need in order to create that output? 
#What do I have now? What is missing? 

#How do we develop the problem solving muscle? 
#Same as any other skill: constant, consicious effort and practice. The great thing about learning to program is that you have constant access to problems that help build this skill. Every lab and every realworld observation is an opportunity to practice and get better.
