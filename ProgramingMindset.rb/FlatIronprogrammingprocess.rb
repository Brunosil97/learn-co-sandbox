#We can break the process down: 

#1)Identify the problem, 2)Identify the output that would solve the problem 3)Name the procedure that fixes the problem 4)Identify what inputs are needed to create the output 5)Define the procedure implementation 6)Translate the procedure description into code 7)Verify the procedures output 

#Identify the problem:
#When you run into a programming problem, it's easy to get lost in the code. Take a step back and think about what you're trying to accomplish beyond the output. For example, what are the needs of the customer you're coding for? 

#Identify the output that would solve the problem:
#After you've figured out what general solution you want, it's time to get a little more specific. What output is going to fit that solution? For example, maybe you can pinpoint that your result should be an average of numbers or a whole number with two places of numbers after the decimal. Once youve determined the precise output, you can start building a plan towards it.

#Name the procedure that fixes the problem:
#What will produce the desired output? If we need that average, we add together all of the values in our set and divide by the number of the values to get a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. 

#Identify what inputs are needed to create the output:
#In order to start the steps of getting the output, we have to know what items we're going to need during the process. To continue our examples
    #if we want an average of numbers, we need all of those values and the total number of values
    #if we want a sandwich, we'll need the ingredients (peanut butter, jelly and bread) and tools (a knife, cutting board, plate)
#You know what your output should be so figure out what input will get it 

#Define the procedures implementation:
#We need to dig into implementation and build out our understanding. It is a set of steps that combine
