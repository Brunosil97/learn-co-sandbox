#Most programmers start coding with feeling like this: a fog of ambiguity, wondering if their solution will work, exploring the way forward the best that they can. 
#We can adjust our own mindset away from the idea that programmers always know that programmers actually just know how to concentrate, test theories and develop a practice of problem solving.

#Mindfulness:
#Mindfulness is programming, as with everything worth doing in life, is the key. It just happens that we're going to build that supporting skill by doing programmming. You're doing right when you're doing work. When it's hard, when you'd rather do something mindless like social media, you're doing the right thing. dont stop, me mindful. 

#Bravery:
#Solving problems that no one has completed before, or that have stymied the most brilliant humans ever to walk this earth is daunting. Who are you, who am I, who are we to dare such things?
#Embrace uncertainty, but also embrace your inner warrior.You are in a battle against your own unknowing. 

#Focus: 
#When you feel the distraction machines chewing at your attention, realise that they are multi billion dollar industries that profit from keeping your attention like an addict and seelling it off. The only thing keeping you from this fate is your will. #In general when you hit a bug, when you hit a problem, dont get up from the computer. stick with it and dont lose your game face.

#Don't flail:
#Work from a problem solving process. Don't randomly add code and hope that this next run will somehow magically get the answer. Make sure that each time you run the code that you expect it to output some validation of your direction. 

#Don't curate the internets solutions:
#Learn from the solutions, see the part you're missing, update your process. but if you simply use someone else's solution but don't enrich your mental models you've made the poorest investment possible. 

#respect the problem:
#Lastly and perhaps the most important, guideline: respect the problem. Sometimes the problem seems simple, but when you dig into it's really more complicated. Be honest with yourself and peers, bosses and callaborators and own up to having misjudged the size of the problem. 
#Sometimes the problems interconnected to other parts of the system in surprising ways, Sometimes there's a hidden snarl of complex code you didn't expect to find. Perhaps the code depends on mathematics or business knowledge you dont have that you need to learn more about.
