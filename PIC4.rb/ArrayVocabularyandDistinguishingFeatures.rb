#Intro:
#Much of life is understood by grouping things together based on a common characteristic. For instnce:
#Family last name, band name, grocery list 

#In most programming languages, the thing for storing a collection is called an "Array". As we learn, can also be used to order the things in the collection. ("get the youngest Simpson" or "last grocery item")
#Working with arrays is one of the most important tools to master in your programming career. 

#Recognise Array as a core programming tool:
#The bulk of all programming work is taking inputs, doing some change to them (combing them, filtering them, attacking them together, etc), and producing new output. 

#An array allows programmers to: 
#create variables that store the input or output. 
#Create variables that tell other programmers "there are a bunch of individuals data bits here, but, together, theymake up something else, a collection, and knowing that fact is important."

#Like all data structures, the array has rules and we'll explore them in this lesson.

#Lets use the shark family, as ordered by age, youngest to oldest

# Baby Shark, Mama Shark, Papa Shark, Grandma Shark, Grandpa Shark 
         #An individual in an array is an element. So all these sharks are elements
  #The main rule of the array data structure is that the individual elements in an array can be "pointed to" by providing a number (Integer) and the name of the array. For example "baby shark" would be (0) and "grandpa shark" would be (5)
  
#ordering:
#Because arrays' elements are indexed by numbers that increase from a starting number by whole numbers, arrays can be used to keep elements in order. Programmers use the ordering property of the indexes to keep the collection in order. If the shark family had a new baby shark we would put her in index 1 and move all the other sharks up one.

#Newborn baby sister shark, baby shark, mama shark, papa shark, grandma shark, grandpa shark.
