#Intro:

#NDS are giant collections of facts, like an encyclopedia. We have to take the knowledge from an encyclopedia and do work with those facts to create new insights.
#For example, by researching Colombia, the history of soccer and south american history you can write a report about "Soccer in South America". We can synthesize facts into insight. 
#By applying code to NDS, we can synthesise insights from the raw facts contained in NDS 

#examples: 
#What's the average age of people in the NDS representing a class of students?" 
#How many pieces of candy are in this vending machine?
#In what year will most of my employees reach retirement age so I can plan 401k contributions?

#But sometimes it can be downright scary to get started. You get a big old blob of Array of Hash of Array of Array literals and you get stuck.

#NDS to Insight strategy 
#1) Understand the NDS 
  #2) "Pretty print" NDS with pp 
  #3) Home-grown pretty print NDS 
#4) Use [] to verify your understanding from step 1 
  #5) Print values to verify your understanding 
  #6)Leave code comments and documentation for yourself
#7)Wrap uses of [] from step 2 into new methods 
  #8)Create simple methods with meanginful names ("First order methods")
  #9)Ensure First Order methods" use arguments to create flexibility 
#10) See-saw between bottom-up and top-down method writing 
  #11)Write a method that provides an insight e.g. oldest_student 
  #12)Evaluate your First Order Methods 
  #13)Can you use your First-order methods to build the insight methods implementation?
  #14) Yes, great, method is done
  #15) No, build a new method that combines other methods to get closer to what the insight method needs. Repeat step 4 
#16) Insight method provides an insight
