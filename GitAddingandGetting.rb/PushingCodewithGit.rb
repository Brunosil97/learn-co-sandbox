#Intro:
#How we mirror our local repository to a remote repository using git push and git remote:
#Once your code is on a remote, its backed up - which is always a good thing. Also, once you push to a remote, you can choose whether to let others fork or clone and benefit from it. 

#Create a remote repository on GitHub:
#go to : github.com/new, while logged into GitHub 
#Enter a name for your repository in the "name"
#After you create the remote repository, you should see a "quick setup" page. Make sure the SSH option is selected, then click the "copy to clipboard" symbol next to the repo URL to copy the URL. 

#Connect a local repository to a remote repository: 
#After you've created your remote GitHub repository, you'll want to get your local repository uploaded to GitHub.:
